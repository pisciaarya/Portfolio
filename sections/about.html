    <p id="justify">
      I am Aarya Pant, a fourth-year Geomatics Engineering student at Kathmandu University,
      With a deep passion for leveraging spatial technologies to address real-world challenges.
      My core interests lie in disaster management, hazard assessment, and risk analysis,
      where I aim to use geospatial data to support humanitarian efforts and build resilient communities.
      I am driven by the belief that technology should serve people, especially in times of crisis.
      Through academic research, hands-on projects, and continuous learning, I strive to create impactful
      solutions that can aid in early warning systems, vulnerability mapping, and informed decision-making
      for disaster preparedness and response.

      Other than that I have great interest in content creation,
      web developement, video editing, and reading books.
